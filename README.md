# Power-Glove
This is the code for my selfmade Power-Glove-Project
The Powerglove was made with an MPU9150 , several Flexsensores, an 16x2 LCD Display, several original Buttons and an Arduino Nano.
In this repository is the Arduino-file called "Powerglove" and an Visual-Studios-program for the 3D-Model-Simulation.
To run it you just have to go to /Glove/Biuld/Glove.
