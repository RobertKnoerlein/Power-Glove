# Power-Glove
This is the code for my DIY Power-Glove-Project.
The Powerglove was made with an MPU9150 , 4 Flexsensores, an 16x2 LCD Display, several original Buttons, an HC6 Bluetoothdevice and an Arduino Nano.
In this repository is the Arduino-file called "Powerglove.ino" and an Visual-Studios-Program for the 3D-Model-Simulation called "Glove.rar" as an zip-file.
I also just want to refer to Kriswiner (https://github.com/kriswiner/MPU-9250), who layed the foundation of code for the calibration of my IMU.
